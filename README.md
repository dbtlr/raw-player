# Raw Player

**Warning, this is an experiment and a work in progress. It may be handy for you to learn from but it is not intended to be used for anything other than educational purposes.**

This is an experiment in building a JavaScript video player without any frameworks or libraries. The only exception to this is that I'm using webpack and babel in order to compile ES6 into browser ready code.
